### Goals of Class 1:

 - learn the computer history which led to Arduino
 - learn what open source development means: code is social media
 - learn what Arduino is and get some idea of what it can do
 - download and install Arduino IDE
 - connect Arduino UNO to computer, make sure IDE can see it
 - get LED to blink
 - tell a story with a blinking light and share it
 - run someone else's story and share that(code as social media)

### Computers: in the beginning, the blinking lights!
