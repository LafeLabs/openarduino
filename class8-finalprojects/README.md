#  Final Projects: Open Source Hardware Product

The most important thing about a technology product is not the technology or product it is what we deliver to our customer.

Our customer is the parents of students in the STEM programs.  

Our product is parental pride in your work.  

Our platform is a series of very brief presentations in an auditorium.

We have the equivalent of one work day to finish this (4 classes of 2 hours each = 8 hours)

We have no real budget beyond the parts we have on hand and craft supplies in the STEM academy rooms.

Our goal is to maximize impact on parents.  Ultimately, this is entertainment and education, we are in the same business and Neil Degrasse Tyson or Bill Nye.

The most fun to look at product we have is blinking lights.  These also do not require complex debugging of hardware/software at the same time.  But they also allow for programs which are very clearly unique to each student.  We also have access to brightly colored duct tape, cardboard, and various simple craft supplies. 


Product:

### Sequential blinking art installation

A blinking light Rube Goldberg machine.  Each student and instructor will create a module which has an Arduino powered by a 9 volt wall supply which has an input wire and output wire.  We will connect them all in a sequence.  When a button is pushed on the first machine, it will start a chain reaction going down the line, where each module carries out its fixed sequence of flashing lights in order.  We will set all this up as a demo where parents can walk by and push the button to see it. We will record a video which pans along and shows the whole sequence, showing each students name next to their module, and display this video in the presentation.  Then we will document the whole thing in an open source Github repository which anyone in the world can copy, and we will have collectively created a free open source hardware product, totally unique to the group of people in this room but also which can be modified and copied and improved upon by anyone. 

Plan:

**First**: get everyone a working unit in the sequence: each student should have a UNO plugged into a 9 V supply which runs a simple light sequence on the 8 pixel strip when triggered, then outputs a trigger.  

**Second**: Think of what you want your program to do and what you want to craft.  You can use the 8 pixel strip, the 16 pixel ring, or chain them both together in sequence.  Think of what you want the program to do on paper first, discuss it, make it your own.    This step is just on paper, but it also includes sketching out what you want to craft with what we can find here in the STEM academy(duct tape, cardboard, popsicle sticks)

**Third**:  When you know what you want the lights to do, write the program to make that happen and debug it, get it working, save that program and share with the class.  This will be part of the code set we publish in the finished Github Repository.

**Fourth**:  Craft up your section of the art installation.  TEST, TEST, TEST!!!  When we have it all working, record video of the sequence, a couple times.  Edit video? I am bad at video editing, does anyone want to volunteer?  This video is our product for the presentation to parents.  We must avoid letting great be the enemy of good to get a simple clear video ready in time.  Video must clearly call out each student's stage in the sequence(each stage should also be labelled with your name clearly) as it goes so all students get full credit for their work in the video.

**Fifth**: photograph everything.  Save photos to the Github Repository which has a photo of each student's stage in the sequence.  Incorporate each students code in the repository.  Publish the whole thing on an open license, copy, share. 

**Sixth**: share and replicate!  If this class is repeated, there can be more and more of these, all unique, as more teachers copy the class and more students build new projects.  Depending on time and resources, the machines can get more and more advanced.  Motors can drive levers which push buttons, or topple a tower with an accelerometer etc.  All this is possible, but always aim for a technology simple enough that students don't spend all their time getting it to work, but spend more time thinking about the art and craft of it, building an interesting story, and demonstrating, sharing, and documenting all of it.
