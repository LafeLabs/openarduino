#  Final Projects: Open Source Hardware Product

The most important thing about a technology product is not the technology or product it is what we deliver to our customer.

Our customer is the parents of students in the STEM programs.  

Our product is parental pride in your work.  

Our platform is a series of very brief presentations in an auditorium.

We have the equivalent of one work day to finish this (4 classes of 2 hours each)

We have no real budget beyond the parts we have on hand and craft supplies in the STEM academy rooms.

Our goal is to maximize impact on parents.  Ultimately, this is entertainment and education, we are in the same business and Neil Degrasse Tyson or Bill Nye.

The most fun to look at product we have is blinking lights.  These also do not require complex debugging of hardware/software at the same time.  But they also allow for programs which are very clearly unique to each student.  We also have access to brightly colored duct tape, cardboard, and various simple craft supplies. 

Product:

A blinking light Rube Goldberg machine.  Each student and instructor will create a module which has an Arduino powered by a 9 volt wall supply which has an input wire and output wire.  We will connect them all in a sequence.  When a button is pushed on the first machine, it will start a chain reaction going down the line, where each module carries out its fixed sequence of flashing lights in order.  We will set all this up as a demo where parents can walk by and push the button to see it. We will record a video which pans along and shows the whole sequence, showing each students name next to their module, and display this video in the presentation.  Then we will document the whole thing in an open source Github repository which anyone in the world can copy, and we will have collectively created a free open source hardware product, totally unique to the group of people in this room but also which can be modified and copied and improved upon by anyone.
