#  Github: social media for technology creators

What is Github?  Github is a for profit corporation owned by Microsoft(acquired in 2018 for $7.5 billion) which hosts repositories of files for technology projects.  It is one of the most widely used platforms on which people publish open source projects.   Microsoft's embrace of the open source movement has been a long trajectory from Steve Balmer calling it "like a cancer" to Microsoft being one of the largest contributors of open source code on Github(the code editor Visual Studio Code is for example entirely free open source software).  

It uses the version control system Git, which is itself open source and unlike Github is not for profit.  Personally,  I loathe Git and think it is hard to use and adds a ton of pointless complexity.  But you can avoid the complexity with a simple GUI provided by Github Desktop, and it is useful socially to have your things published on Github.  

The default for human readable files on Github is the Markdown language, which is what this document is written in. 

## Today's goals

 - create a free account on Github
 - create a new repository for your final project
 - create a README for the project with a brief summary in Markdown
 - create a repository with a free web page hosted at [username.github.io] and publish to web(if we have time)
 - talk about how this will all feed into our shared final project(Rube Goldberg!)
 - if we have even more time, 3d printer demo
